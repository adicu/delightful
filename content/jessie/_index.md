thank you for being so fun and happy! its contagious

Jessie you have been an incredible person to get to know in ADI. Your smile and positivity is always the light of ADI! Have fun at your semester abroad and don’t forget about us!!

LIL J! Sad I didn't get to know you earlier while at Columbia - you're totes fun to hang out with and a worthy naked salad bowl competitor! Definitely gonna miss you lots when you head halfway across the globe - please stay in touch! I'm calling a raincheck on our dumpling competition, so we better have that sometime soon! :)

Jessie, you are one of the most wholesome person I know! I've enjoyed so much working with you, getting to know you better, bonding together over how we both miss Sneha (lol), making fun gifts together, or just chatting. I've always admired you for being so smart, being a fellow kickass woman TA, being so resourceful and calm. I will miss you tons!!! Much love and have fun abroad!

Jessie is such a positive influence to all those around her. I'll be missing her!

i have stared excellence in the face, and it is beautiful. jessie you have the singular ability to have all your shit together and similtaneously be a complete mess, and it inspires me. you're someone i can always count on to be angsty and existential with (lmao), but then behind that you can be so sincere and perceptive, and you give great advice. you’ve been a kind and sensitive friend and i will miss you next semester!

HELLO BEAN! I hope you have a blast in HK. Take tons of pics and eat some lit tofu for me!!! your quirky, fun, intelligent self will be very missed

Jessie! I'm so glad I got to know you better this semester! You are so chill and such a open person. I can't wait to hear about your study abroad experience in Hong Kong. Eat a shit ton and have fun!

Will you are one of the funniest people Iâ€™ve met. Keep up your great energy and I hope you do freat things for ADI this year!

Will!! Looking forward to teaching you how to use Illustrator :P I'm sure you'd be one of my best disciples haha. Have an amazing break!

Excited about how ready you are to start new ADI initiatives even in your second semester senior year!

Will! I've been completely amazed by how you've hit the ground running in ADI and how active you are.

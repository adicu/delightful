You're genuinely caring and an awesome person. I hope to get to know you better throughout the years and that we can work togwther for ADI! (Also, I will remember that you are a sophomore, not a freshman, I promise :)

Your resourcefulness and joy are a true inspiration to me! Sometimes you'll randomly message me and my day gets 101013134234x's better

Erinn! We don't have an official sunshine chair but with you joining us we might as well - thank you for spreading sunshine and happiness everywhere you go, ADI included

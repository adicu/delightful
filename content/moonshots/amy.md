Amy! You are such a cutie! <3 I love your energy and I hope you'll get to bring a smile to other committee members like you did to me. :)

You are incredibly fun, smart, and it makes me so proud to be your fellow Barnard ADI sister! Much love!

BARNARD BABEEE!!!! I love you sooo much! Seeing you makes my heart warm and I literally am so happy you're a part of our family! You're going to do incredible things for committee, this community, and what you do in our internal space. You are amazing and I look forward to eating more Diana Pizza together :*

Amy!!! I'm so happy that you've joined us! You are so curious and patient and consistent - I can't wait to work together more and I'm sure you're destined for success within and outside of ADI.
